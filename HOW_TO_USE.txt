# DupliGone - How To Use

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
- Azure Blob Storage account
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment

## 1. Setup
- Clone the repository.
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Set environment variables for MongoDB and Azure credentials (see `.env.example`).

## 2. Start the Backend
- Run FastAPI server:
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
- Start Celery worker:
  ```bash
  celery -A tasks.image_tasks worker --loglevel=info
  ```
- (Optional) Start with Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

## 3. Using the Web UI
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
- Upload images via drag-and-drop or file picker.
- Wait for processing (progress is shown).
- Review each cluster (group of similar images) one at a time.
- Select which images to keep or delete in each group.
- Confirm deletion, or use dry run to preview results.

## 4. Cleanup
- To remove old sessions and free up storage, run:
  ```bash
  python scripts/cleanup.py
  ```
- You can set the retention period with the `CLEANUP_DAYS` environment variable.

## 5. Tuning & Customization
- To make clustering stricter or looser, edit `services/image_processing.py` (see `find_optimal_eps_with_elbow`).
- To adjust quality ranking, modify the weights in the quality metric calculation.

## 6. Troubleshooting
- Check logs in the terminal for errors.
- Ensure MongoDB and Azure credentials are correct.
- For UI issues, refresh the browser and check the browser console.
